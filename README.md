## About
Developed a Group chat application using Flutter and Firebase, where users can register and create groups or join already existing groups and start conversing with each other.
This application is based on that of Ahmed Gulab Khan to whom I send my thanks. Features will be added, code modified as well as the design.

Dark Mode is enabled or disabled based on whether the system's theme is dark or light.

## Configuration Steps
1. Cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/friends/enyo10.git
```

2. Open the project and install dependencies (using terminal):

```
$ cd GroupChatApp
$ flutter pub get
```
This installs all the required dependencies like cloud_firestore, shared_preferences, flutter_spinkit etc...

3. Make an android project on your firebase account, follow the mentioned steps and you're good to go.

4. Now run the app on your connected device (using terminal):

`$ flutter run`
